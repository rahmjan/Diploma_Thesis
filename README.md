# Diploma_Thesis
The diploma thesis deals with selected algorithms of multivariate cryptography,
especially Unbalanced Oil & Vintage and Rainbow. The aim of this
work is implementation of algorithms in Wolfram Mathematica, investigation
of existing solutions and their implementation on ESP32 microcontroller. The
algorithms are tested and measured against the RSA and ECDSA algorithms.  

**Keywords** Multivariate cryptography, Unbalanced Oil & Vintage, Rainbow,
Wolfram Mathematica, ESP32
